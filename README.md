Folder with simple programs helpful in teaching mathematics

In the 'generating_latex_files' folder you will find files that generate PDF documents using the pylatex library. The documentation for pylatex can be found at https://jeltef.github.io/PyLaTeX/current/.

pylatex is a Python library that allows you to programmatically create LaTeX documents. It provides a convenient way to generate complex documents with mathematical equations, figures, tables, and other elements. With pylatex, you can automate the creation of reports, papers, and other documents that require mathematical typesetting. It also integrates with other Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, making it a powerful tool for scientific computing.
